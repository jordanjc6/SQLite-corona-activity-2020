Looking at the corona_activity_data on a global scale:

Time range of dataset?

2020-01-21 to 2020-12-28

Total deaths as of 2020-12-28?

1,774,680

SOL'N:

SELECT SUM(PEOPLE_DEATH_COUNT) AS 'Total Global Deaths'
FROM corona_activity_data
WHERE REPORT_DATE = '2020-12-28';

Countries with the highest death count? Countries with the least?

SOL'N:

SELECT COUNTRY_SHORT_NAME AS 'Country', SUM(PEOPLE_DEATH_COUNT) AS 'Total Deaths'
FROM corona_activity_data
WHERE REPORT_DATE = '2020-12-28'
GROUP BY COUNTRY_SHORT_NAME
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

Global positive cases each month? Percent change?

SOL'N:

WITH month AS (
SELECT CAST(SUBSTR(REPORT_DATE, 6, 7) AS INTEGER) AS 'Month',
	CAST(SUM(PEOPLE_POSITIVE_CASES_COUNT) AS REAL) AS 'Global_Positive_Cases'
FROM corona_activity_data
GROUP BY 1
), previous_month AS (
SELECT CAST(SUBSTR(REPORT_DATE, 6, 7) AS INTEGER) + 1 AS 'Month',
	CAST(SUM(PEOPLE_POSITIVE_CASES_COUNT) AS REAL) AS 'Global_Positive_Cases'
FROM corona_activity_data
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT month.Month, month.Global_Positive_Cases,
	ROUND( (month.Global_Positive_Cases - previous_month.Global_Positive_Cases) / previous_month.Global_Positive_Cases * 100, 2 )
		AS 'Percent_Change'
FROM month
LEFT JOIN previous_month
ON month.Month = previous_month.Month;



Looking at the corona_activity_data in Canada:

Stats for each province by month?

SOL'N:

For Ontario...

SELECT SUBSTR(REPORT_DATE, 6, 2) AS 'Month', PROVINCE_STATE_NAME AS 'Province',
	SUM(PEOPLE_POSITIVE_NEW_CASES_COUNT) AS 'New_Cases', MAX(PEOPLE_POSITIVE_CASES_COUNT) AS 'Total_Cases', 
	SUM(PEOPLE_DEATH_NEW_COUNT) AS 'New_Deaths', MAX(PEOPLE_DEATH_COUNT) AS 'Total_Deaths'
FROM corona_activity_data
WHERE PROVINCE_STATE_NAME = 'Ontario'
GROUP BY 1;
